## A few projects

- [Waffle](https://github.com/someodd/waffle) — client application work; protocols, profiling, testing, correctness

## Outside work

I keep [small personal systems projects](http://www.someodd.zip/tags/my_servs/) going for fun.  
Infra, automation, reliability.  
It keeps my hands warm. It leaks into how I ship.
