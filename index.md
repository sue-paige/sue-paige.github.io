- Operating public services in-house, like radio, forum, IRC, XMPP, Counter-Strike 1.6, and more.
- Contributor to open-source projects like Nix.

#### Self-hosting extraordinaire

A preview of the services I host ([many services outlined on my tech website](https://someodd.zip)):

* [web radio](https://radio.someodd.zip/)
* [Gopher Protocol server](https://codemadness.org/gopherproxy/?q=gopher.someodd.zip/) -- this acts as a single point of truth, the most up-to-date source of all my tech stuff. Built and served using [my bore software](https://github.com/someodd/bore)! Has features like "ChatGopherPT" which allows you to use an LLM/AI via the Gopher Protocol!
* [Counter-Strike 1.6 server](https://codemadness.org/gopherproxy/?q=gopher.someodd.zip/0/services/counter-strike.md) for old school gaming! I even have [my own Mumble server](https://codemadness.org/gopherproxy/?q=gopher.someodd.zip/0/services/mumble.md)! Weekly event every Saturday!
* [phorum](https://codemadness.org/gopherproxy/?q=gopher.someodd.zip/1/phorum): Gopher Protocol forum!
* [I host my own XMPP](https://codemadness.org/gopherproxy/?q=gopher.someodd.zip/0/services/xmpp.md), you can contact me via `someodd@xmpp.someodd.zip`!
* [IRC server](https://codemadness.org/gopherproxy/?q=gopher.someodd.zip/0/services/irc.md): you can actually join this through my XMPP server! Actually surprisingly active with some amazing people!

#### Bore

Bore is like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static website builder, except it's for the [Gopher Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)). Some of the highlights:

* Formal verification using [LiquidHaskell](https://ucsd-progsys.github.io/liquidhaskell/) for the custom search algorithm
* Property-based testing using [QuickCheck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickCheck) for the custom search algorithm
* Blogging system, with Atom/RSS, tagging, indexing

Some examples:

  * [My technical website's phlog-mirror](https://www.someodd.zip/phlog-mirror/) gets built by Bore's command to archive to Jekyll!
  * [View the gopherhole built by Bore using an HTTP proxy](https://codemadness.org/gopherproxy/?q=gopher.someodd.zip%2F)

#### haskellcard

[haskellcard](https://github.com/someodd/haskellcard) is a game engine built in Haskell, that is similar to [HyperCard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard).

  * Nix packages setup for building and development
  * Game state and level format is the same thing and perfectly deterministic

#### Whisper Radio

[Whisper Radio](https://radio.someodd.zip/stream) is a radio show hosted by AI and Bash scripts. It is ([open source](https://github.com/someodd/whisper-radio)).

The radio program has these features (and more!):

* AI responds to people's posts on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.org)
* Selects music to play
* Radio announcer (using both old school TTS *and* AI-based TTS)
* Weather report
* Reads the latest thread in my Gopher forum [phorum](https://codemadness.org/gopherproxy/?q=gopher.someodd.zip%2F1%2Fphorum)
* Talking/reading segments, like promoting people's projects, or reading poetry, interesting bits of history

You can listen below, or [go to the Whisper Radio stream directly](https://radio.someodd.zip).

#### Waffle

[Waffle](https://github.com/someodd/waffle) is like a web browser, but for the Gopher Protocol. I wrote about the experience extensively in [my article showcasing Waffle on my tech website](https://www.someodd.zip/showcase/waffle/), which includes:

* Extensive use of performance profiling
* Parallelism and concurrency
* Implementation of client side of [RFC 1436](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1436)
