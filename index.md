Reach out via email for detailed information on my past projects (including my resume, or older body of work [older GitHub]), or if you want to utilize my experience: [hi@sue.do](mailto:hi@sue.do).

## What I do best

- **Senior engineering leadership:** designing, shipping, and owning production systems (Haskell, Python)
- **Infrastructure & reliability:** self-hosted systems, performance, security, and operational ownership
- **Cross-cultural work (secondary):** consulting and community projects involving China–US collaboration

## Accomplishments

Some more abstract things (feel free to ask for evidence for what I have not made publicly accessible):

- I'm a member of [Bitreich](https://bitreich.org)
- 15+ years building and operating production software (startups, academia, independent projects)
- CTO-level ownership of Haskell/Python systems (architecture, delivery, security)
- Led teams shipping products under real operational constraints
- Open-source software with sustained usage (incl. a PyPI project reaching ~800 downloads/month, popularity on Hacker news)
- Delivered technical talks and workshops
- Led technology nonprofit
- Chinese cultural: Appearing in Chinese news (e.g., [Sing Tao Daily](https://www.singtaousa.com/)) [I should have a specific link here], Event organizing with Chinatown community and avid financial supporter, especially with the San Francisco Chinese Opera scene, working with [Jing Ying Cantonese Opera Institute](https://www.jingyingcantoneseopera.org/)

## Selected Work

Some flashy projects to show off; a portfolio you can play with. First checkout:

- My [Haskell GitHub](https://github.com/someodd) demonstrates 6+ years of Haskell expertise, including formal verification of custom algorithms, contributing to both research and practical implementations. I also have an older GitHub which is mostly Python you can request.
- I also have a [website for my current technical body of work](https://www.someodd.zip)
- Contributor to open-source projects like Nix.

#### Self-hosting extraordinaire

A preview of the services I host ([many services outlined on my tech website](https://someodd.zip)) on my own server, in my home:

* [Gopher Protocol server](https://codemadness.org/gopherproxy/?q=gopher.someodd.zip/) -- this acts as a single point of truth, the most up-to-date source of all my tech stuff. Built and served using [my bore software](https://github.com/someodd/bore)! Has features like "ChatGopherPT" which allows you to use an LLM/AI via the Gopher Protocol!
* [Counter-Strike 1.6 server](https://codemadness.org/gopherproxy/?q=gopher.someodd.zip/0/services/counter-strike.md) for old school gaming! I even have [my own Mumble server](https://codemadness.org/gopherproxy/?q=gopher.someodd.zip/0/services/mumble.md)! Weekly event every Saturday!
* [phorum](https://codemadness.org/gopherproxy/?q=gopher.someodd.zip/1/phorum): Gopher Protocol forum!
* [I host my own XMPP](https://codemadness.org/gopherproxy/?q=gopher.someodd.zip/0/services/xmpp.md), you can contact me via `someodd@xmpp.someodd.zip`!
* [IRC server](https://codemadness.org/gopherproxy/?q=gopher.someodd.zip/0/services/irc.md): you can actually join this through my XMPP server! Actually surprisingly active with some amazing people!

#### I wrote my own Internet Gopher Protocol Stack

I even have an article about this, but my publishing stack weaves an ancient Internet protocol together with the modern web and Jekyll. Check out [my gopherhole](https://gopher.someodd.zip) (built with this stack). Here are some highlights of my stack:

* Bore is like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static website builder, except it's for the [Gopher Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)). Blogging system, with Atom/RSS, tagging, indexing

* Formal verification using [LiquidHaskell](https://ucsd-progsys.github.io/liquidhaskell/) for the custom search algorithm, through my [ryvm (Rank You Very Much)](https://github.com/someodd/ryvm) software
* Property-based testing using [QuickCheck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickCheck) for the custom search algorithm
* Venusia is a Gopher framework, allowing to be used as a kind of reverse proxy and dynamic gopher content daemon.

[My blog](https://www.someodd.zip/phlog-mirror/) is a mirror of my gopherhole built by this stack.

#### haskellcard

[haskellcard](https://github.com/someodd/haskellcard) is an SDL game engine built in Haskell, that is similar to [HyperCard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard).

  * Nix packages setup for building, and development environment
  * Game state and level format is the same thing and perfectly deterministic

#### Whisper Radio

[Whisper Radio](https://radio.someodd.zip/) is a radio show hosted by AI and Bash scripts. It is ([open source](https://github.com/someodd/whisper-radio)).

The radio program has these features (and more!):

* AI responds to people's posts on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.org)
* Selects music to play
* Radio announcer (using both old school TTS *and* AI-based TTS)
* Weather report
* Reads the latest thread in my Gopher forum [phorum](https://codemadness.org/gopherproxy/?q=gopher.someodd.zip%2F1%2Fphorum)
* Talking/reading segments, like promoting people's projects, or reading poetry, interesting bits of history
* Hosted on my home server
* News segment

You can listen below, or [go to the Whisper Radio stream directly](https://radio.someodd.zip).

#### Waffle

[Waffle](https://github.com/someodd/waffle) is like a web browser, but for the Gopher Protocol. I wrote about the experience extensively in [my article showcasing Waffle on my tech website](https://www.someodd.zip/showcase/waffle/), which includes:

* Extensive use of performance profiling
* Parallelism and concurrency
* Implementation of client side of [RFC 1436](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1436)

The domain name `sue.do` is a play on the `sudo` command in Linux.

## Volunteer work

### Chinatown

![A photo I took backstage at a performance at Great Star Theater](/assets/images/chinatown-volunteering-backstage.jpg)

I have been learning Mandarin and appreciate Chinese culture. I have volunteered for two Chinese (Cantonese) opera houses in Chinatown San Francisco: My Opera and Jing Ying Cantonese Opera.

### The MADE

Working on a documentary for [The Museum of Art and Digital Entertainment](https://themade.org)...
