# Sue Paige

Almost 20 years of production systems.  
Haskell. Python. Infrastructure. Reliability.  
**Available for remote roles.**

## Competencies

**System Ownership** End-to-end architecture of long-running production systems. Operability, cost, and longevity are not afterthoughts; they are the product.

**Engineering Leadership** Leading small, high-output teams with calm momentum. I favor practical, security-minded engineering over loud, complex abstractions.

**Cross-Cultural Operations** Specialized technical and consulting work bridging China and the US.

## Select Works

**Waffle:** [Code & Analysis](https://github.com/someodd/waffle)  
Client application engineering focused on protocols, memory profiling, and correctness.

**Whisper Radio:** [Live Station](https://radio.someodd.zip)  
A bot-controlled audio stream exploring automated curation.

**Haskellcard:** [Engine Architecture](https://github.com/someodd/haskellcard)  
A Haskell game engine emphasizing deterministic state and functional systems design.

## The Laboratory (someodd.zip)

My experimental work happens at **[someodd.zip](http://www.someodd.zip/)**.

That is where I keep personal systems, Gopher servers, and automation projects. It is a space for raw engineering and keeping my hands warm. It leaks into how I ship: reliable, simple, and understood.

## Community

I maintain ongoing volunteer commitments with arts and cultural organizations, with a specific focus on San Francisco Chinatown.
