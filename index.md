## What I do best

- **Senior engineering leadership:** designing, shipping, and owning production systems (Haskell, Python)
- **Infrastructure & reliability:** self-hosted systems, performance, security, and operational ownership
- **Cross-cultural work (secondary):** consulting and community projects involving China–US collaboration

## Accomplishments

Some more abstract things (feel free to inquire for what I have not made publicly accessible):

- I'm a member of [Bitreich](https://bitreich.org)
- 15+ years building and operating production software (startups, academia, independent projects)
- CTO-level ownership of Haskell/Python systems (architecture, delivery, security)
- Led teams shipping products under real operational constraints
- Open-source software with sustained usage (incl. a PyPI project reaching ~800 downloads/month, HN exposure)
- Delivered technical talks and workshops (including LibrePlanet)
- Led technology nonprofit (100+ members)
- Featured in Chinese-language media (e.g., Sing Tao Daily); community event support within San Francisco Chinatown arts organizations

## Selected Work

Some flashy projects to show off; a portfolio you can play with. First checkout:

- [Haskell GitHub](https://github.com/someodd): 6+ years of production and research-grade work (incl. formal verification)
- I also have a [website for my current technical body of work](https://www.someodd.zip)
- Contributor to open-source projects like Nix.

#### Self-hosting extraordinaire

Some services I host at home:

* [Gopher Protocol server](https://codemadness.org/gopherproxy/?q=gopher.someodd.zip/) -- my main place on the net.
* [Counter-Strike 1.6 server](https://codemadness.org/gopherproxy/?q=gopher.someodd.zip/0/services/counter-strike.md) for old school gaming! I even have [my own Mumble server](https://codemadness.org/gopherproxy/?q=gopher.someodd.zip/0/services/mumble.md)! Weekly event every Saturday!
* [phorum](https://codemadness.org/gopherproxy/?q=gopher.someodd.zip/1/phorum): Gopher Protocol forum!
* [I host my own XMPP](https://codemadness.org/gopherproxy/?q=gopher.someodd.zip/0/services/xmpp.md), you can contact me via `someodd@xmpp.someodd.zip`!
* [IRC server](https://codemadness.org/gopherproxy/?q=gopher.someodd.zip/0/services/irc.md): you can actually join this through my XMPP server! Actually surprisingly active with some influential people in tech!

#### Gopher publishing stack (Haskell)

Designed and built a production publishing stack for the Gopher protocol.

* Weaves an ancient Internet protocol together with the modern web and Jekyll.
* Example: [my gopherhole](https://gopher.someodd.zip), which has features like "ChatGopherPT" which allows you to use an LLM/AI via the Gopher Protocol!

* One part of the stack, Bore, is like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static website builder, except it's for the [Gopher Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)). Blogging system, with Atom/RSS, tagging, indexing.
  * [My blog](https://www.someodd.zip/phlog-mirror/) is a mirror of my gopherhole built by this stack.

* Formal verification using [LiquidHaskell](https://ucsd-progsys.github.io/liquidhaskell/) for the custom search algorithm, through my [ryvm (Rank You Very Much)](https://github.com/someodd/ryvm) software
* Property-based testing using [QuickCheck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickCheck) for the custom search algorithm
* [Venusia](https://github.com/someodd/venusia) is a Gopher framework, allowing to be used as a kind of reverse proxy and dynamic gopher content daemon.

#### haskellcard

![img](https://www.someodd.zip/assets/showcase/haskellcard/haskellcard-xmas-release.png)

Albeit a silly demo image above, [haskellcard](https://github.com/someodd/haskellcard) is an SDL game engine built in Haskell, that is similar to [HyperCard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard) with loads of nifty features.

  * Nix packages setup for building, and development environment
  * Game state and level format is the same thing and perfectly deterministic
  * Music queuing.
  * Layer support.
  * Sprite support.
  * Conditional support.
  * Inventory system.

#### Whisper Radio

[Whisper Radio](https://radio.someodd.zip/) is a radio show hosted by AI and Bash scripts. It is ([open source](https://github.com/someodd/whisper-radio)).

The radio program has these features (and more!):

* AI responds to people's posts on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.org)
* Selects music to play
* Experiment on using Bash scripting for a service
* Radio announcer (using both old school TTS *and* AI-based TTS)
* Weather report
* Reads the latest thread in my Gopher forum [phorum](https://codemadness.org/gopherproxy/?q=gopher.someodd.zip%2F1%2Fphorum)
* Talking/reading segments, like promoting people's projects, or reading poetry, interesting bits of history, news
* Hosted on my home server

You can listen below, or [go to the Whisper Radio stream directly](https://radio.someodd.zip).

#### Waffle

[Waffle](https://github.com/someodd/waffle) is like a web browser, but for the Gopher Protocol. I wrote about the experience extensively in [my article showcasing Waffle on my tech website](https://www.someodd.zip/showcase/waffle/), which includes:

* Extensive use of performance profiling
* Parallelism and concurrency
* Implementation of client side of [RFC 1436](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1436)

The domain name `sue.do` is a play on the `sudo` command in Linux.

## Volunteer work

### Chinatown

![A photo I took backstage at a performance at Great Star Theater](/assets/images/chinatown-volunteering-backstage.jpg)

I have been learning Mandarin and appreciate Chinese culture. I have volunteered for two Chinese (Cantonese) opera houses in Chinatown San Francisco: My Opera and [Jing Ying Cantonese Opera](https://www.jingyingcantoneseopera.org/).

### The MADE

Working on a documentary for [The Museum of Art and Digital Entertainment](https://themade.org)...

Please check out [my gopherhole](https://gopher.someodd.zip/) for the most up-to-date information+interesting things. It's my single-point-of-truth.
