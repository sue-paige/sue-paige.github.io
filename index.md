#### Bore

Bore is like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static website builder, except it's for the [Gopher Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)). Some of the highlights:

* Formal verification using [LiquidHaskell] for the custom search algorithm
* Property-based testing using [QuickCheck] for the custom search algorithm
* Blogging system, with Atom/RSS, tagging, indexing

Also, check out [my technical website's phlog-mirror](https://www.someodd.zip/phlog-mirror/), which gets built by Bore's command to archive to Jekyll!

#### Whisper Radio

[Whisper Radio](https://radio.someodd.zip/stream) is a radio show hosted by AI and Bash scripts. It is ([open source](https://github.com/someodd/whisper-radio)).

The radio program has these features (and more!):

* AI responds to people's posts on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.org)
* Selects music to play
* Radio announcer (using both old school TTS *and* AI-based TTS)
* Weather report
* Reads the latest thread in my Gopher forum [phorum](https://codemadness.org/gopherproxy/?q=gopher.someodd.zip%2F1%2Fphorum)
* Talking/reading segments, like promoting people's projects, or reading poetry, interesting bits of history

You can listen below, or [go to the Whisper Radio stream directly](https://radio.someodd.zip).

### Waffle

[Waffle](https://github.com/someodd/waffle) is like a web browser, but for the Gopher Protocol. I wrote about the experience extensively in [my article showcasing Waffle on my tech website](https://www.someodd.zip/showcase/waffle/), which includes:

* Extensive use of performance profiling
* Parallelism and concurrency
* Implementation of client side of [RFC 1436](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1436)
